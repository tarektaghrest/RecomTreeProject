Project Description
RecomTree is a Java-based client–server application simulating the core mechanisms of a
movie recommendation platform, inspired by Netflix’s recommender system. The system
maintains a hierarchical genre tree representing the movie catalog, allows users to browse
and rate titles, and generates simple recommendations using tree-based traversal and
decision strategies.
